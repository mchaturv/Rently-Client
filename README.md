<PopupState variant="popper" popupId="calendar_popper">
    {(popupState) => (
        <ClickAwayListener onClickAway={popupState.close}>
            <div>
                <IconButton {...bindToggle(popupState)}>
                    <DateRangeIcon fontSize={"default"}/>
                </IconButton>

                <Popper {...bindPopper(popupState)} transition>
                    {({ TransitionProps }) => (
                        <Fade {...TransitionProps} timeout={350}>
                            <Paper>
                                <MaterialTypography variant={"subtitle1"} text={"appointments popper"}></MaterialTypography>
                            </Paper>
                        </Fade>
                    )}
                </Popper>
            </div>
        </ClickAwayListener>
    )}
</PopupState> 

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [MaterialUI Popper](https://material-ui.com/components/popper/) as shown below: 

```
<PopupState variant="popper" popupId="demo-popup-popper">
  {(popupState) => (
    <div>
      <Button variant="contained" color="primary" {...bindToggle(popupState)}>
        Toggle Popper
      </Button>
      <Popper {...bindPopper(popupState)} transition>
        {({ TransitionProps }) => (
          <Fade {...TransitionProps} timeout={350}>
            <Paper>
              <Typography className={classes.typography}>The content of the Popper.</Typography>
            </Paper>
          </Fade>
        )}
      </Popper>
    </div>
  )}
</PopupState>

```

- [MaterialUI Popper](https://material-ui.com/components/popper/) is developed by [Material-UI SAS, Paris](https://material-ui.com/company/about/).
- [MaterialUI Popper](https://material-ui.com/components/popper/) was used because the component snippet was useful for the Notification pop-up.
