# Rently - Project 

Rently is a web application that aims to provide a seamless experience for the students to help them in the process of room searching. They can use the platform to search for rooms based on their specific criteria, shortlist rooms they like by adding it to a wish list and book appointments for visiting the property. The owners can use Rently to post advertisements for their room. They can decide and fix the time slots they are available so that tenants can book accordingly.
